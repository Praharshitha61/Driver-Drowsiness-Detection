# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Driver drowsiness is a major factor in the majority of traffic accidents. Drowsiness endangers road safety and can result in serious injuries, leading to the victim’sdeath and financial losses. Drowsiness is defined as a feeling of being fatigued, a loss of attention, or tired eyes when driving a vehicle. The majority of accidents in India occur owing to the driver’s lack of concentration. Drowsiness causes the driver’s performance to steadily decrease. To avert this occurrence, we created a system that can detect the driver’s tiredness and inform him promptly. This system uses a camera to record images as a video stream, recognises the face, and locates the eyes. The eyes are then analysed using an algorithm to detect tiredness.
